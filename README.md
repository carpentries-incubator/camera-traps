# Camera-Trap-Workshop

## Overview of the Camera Trap Wrangling and Analysis workshop

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop uses an raw camera trap dataset and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis and visualization. There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools.

The workshop uses a single camera trap data set that contains observations about snow leopards (Panthera uncia) in the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan. See `data.md` for more information about this data set, including the download location.

Overview of the lessons:

  
  * Camera trap organization in R 
  * Introduction to Whiskerbook (individual identification)
  * Data wrangling in R 
  * oSCR for spatial-capture recapture

## Detailed structure

### Day 1: Data organization & cleaning

There are two lessons in this section. The first is a camera trap lesson that teaches  good data organization, and some data cleaning and quality control checking in a camera trap program.

### Day 2: Data Wrangling and Spatial Capture Recapture

These lessons includes a basic introduction to R syntax for wrangling data for input into the oSCR program. Topics include importing CSV data, and subsetting and merging data. It finishes with calculating summary statistics and running the models.
