The episodes in this lesson cover how to open, work with, and model camera trapping data in R. 
Additional topics include Whiskerbook for individual identification and Spatial Capture Recapture Modeling Data Preparation

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. 


Interested in teaching these materials? Please contact [evebohnett@yahoo.com](mailto:evebohnett@yahoo.com) so that we can discuss a workshop. 


> ## Getting Started
>
> Data Carpentryâ€™s teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use 
> their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient 
> workflow. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download 
> the data and install everything before working through this lesson. 
> 

> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) tab to
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.

> ## Data
>
> The data and lessons in this workshop were originally collected by WCS Afghanistan  
> for a field project located inthe Wakhan Corridor. 
> for snow leopard detections:
> There is one data set included, which are available  on figshare
> * Wakhan Corridor Snow Leopard Data (https://figshare.com/s/5842d402413069e51daf)

> under a CC-BY-04 license. You can download all of the data used in this workshop by clicking 
> Clicking the download link will download all of the files as a single compressed
> (`.zip`) file. To expand this file, double click the folder icon in your file navigator application (for Macs, this is the Finder 
> application).
> 
> These data files represent teaching version of the data, with sufficient complexity to teach many aspects of  data analysis and camera trapping, without providing such a large dataset that the processing takes a long time.
> 
> | Dataset | File name | Description |
> | ---- | ------| ---- | 
> | Camera trap images |  2012_CTdata.zip | Raw camera trap data for 294 images of a subset of data
> | Camera Trap Metadata | Metadata_CT_2012.csv | Metadata that accompanys the camera trap images only| 
> | Whiskerbook export | Whiskerbook_export.csv | A subset of raw data downloaded from the Wildbook interface after the data have been individually identified and labeled by side (left, right, back, front) and quality (high, medium, and low) 
> | Camera Trap Metadata | Metadata_CT_2012_2.csv | Metadata that accompanys the Whiskerbook export file|
