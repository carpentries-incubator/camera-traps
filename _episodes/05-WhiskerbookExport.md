Here are a few of the packages we will be using in this session. Let's load them first thing. 


```r
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

We will import the Whiskerbook file that was exported from the website interface. We are finished with the individual identification tasks. These are the raw data that were downloaded and then annotated with labels for whether the photo capture was high or low quality, and if the encounter showed the left, right, or both sides of the animal. You may choose to label head and tail only images as well. These labels had to be placed manually and are at the discretion of the researcher. 


```r
Wildbook<-read.csv("Whiskerbook_export.csv")
```

Let's do some quick data crunching to find out how many individuals we have in our dataset. 


```r
#To find the number of individuals that are in the dataset
IndividualsCount<-Wildbook%>%
  count(Name0.value, sort = TRUE) 

IndividualsCount2<-IndividualsCount%>%
  count(n, sort = TRUE) 

Individuals<-unique(Wildbook$Name0.value)
```



Next, we can check to see how many encounters we had on each side of the animal and whether they were low or high quality images. 


```r
#To find the number of encounters on each side of the animal and quality
Sides<-Wildbook%>%
  group_by(Side, Quality)%>%
  count(sort = TRUE) 
```

In this next part, we are beginning our construction of a data matrix that we can use for Spatial Capture recapture. The oSCR package requires a certain format for the data, and to get it into the format that oSCR wants, we have to change a few things. 

First, we would like to reconstruct a full date object. Remember our data were previously parsed into year, month and day columns, and now we want a full date again.


```r
#To format dates into a date object we have to combine the month, day and year columns together
Wildbook$date_Time<-paste(Wildbook$Encounter.year, Wildbook$Encounter.month, sep="-")
Wildbook$date_Time<-paste(Wildbook$date_Time, Wildbook$Encounter.day, sep="-")
dateFormat<-"%Y-%m-%d"
Wildbook$date_Time<-as.Date(Wildbook$date_Time,format= dateFormat)
```


Next, we will reload the metadata file that we had used previously with our GPS and camera functionality information.


```r
Metadata<-read.csv("Metadata_CT_2012_2.csv")

#check whether the location names are exactly the same in the Wildbook download and the metadata
setdiff(Wildbook$Encounter.locationID, Metadata$Trap.site)
```

Challenge how to fix these missed entries? From a previous lesson we learned how to manipulate the data to have matching file names. 


```r
Metadata$Trap.site<-str_replace(Metadata$Trap.site,"C18_Khandud","C18_Khundud")
Metadata$Trap.site<-str_replace(Metadata$Trap.site
,"C26_Wargand Payan","C26_Wargand_Payan")
Metadata$Trap.site<-str_replace(Metadata$Trap.site
,"C27_Ragi Jurum","C27_Ragi_Jurem")
Metadata$Trap.site<-str_replace(Metadata$Trap.site
,"C30_Wargand Payan","C30_Wargand_Payan")
Metadata$Trap.site<-str_replace(Metadata$Trap.site
,"C32_Wargand Bala","C32_Wargand_Bala")
Metadata$Trap.site<-str_replace(Metadata$Trap.site
,"C45_Avgarch" ,"C45_Avgach")
Metadata$Trap.site<-str_replace(Metadata$Trap.site
,"C5_Ishmorg" ,"C5_Ishmorgh")
```

Check again whether the names are all exactly the same by using setdiff. 


```r
setdiff(Wildbook$Encounter.locationID, Metadata$Trap.site)
```


Then, we can merge the metadata into our Wildbook download. 

```r
Wildbook2<-merge(Metadata, Wildbook, by="Trap.site", by.y="Encounter.locationID", all=TRUE)
```

Our metadata has more locations then we actually need for these data. 
So, we can subset the dataframe to include only those locations that are actually in the Wildbook. 


```r
Metadata<-Metadata[which(Metadata$Trap.site %in% Wildbook$Encounter.locationID),]
```

Let's save our subset Metadata for later. 


```r
write.csv(Metadata, "Metadata.csv")
```

Now, we only will need certain columns of our Wildbook data. We can easily subset these needed columns and rename them. 

We will also subset the GPS coordinates for our locations into a separate object called Wildbook_points_coords. 


```r
Wildbook_points<-Wildbook2[,c("Name0.value","Encounter.decimalLongitude", "Encounter.decimalLatitude", "Trap.site", "date_Time", "Side","Quality", "Juvenilles") ]

#rename the columns to more recognizable names
colnames(Wildbook_points)<-c("Marked.Individual", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Location.ID","date_Time" ,"Side", "Quality","Juvenilles")

#subset the coordinates.
Wildbook_points_coords<-unique(Wildbook_points[,c(2,3,4)])
```


Now, we will need to transform the lat/long coordinates in the Wildbook back to UTM. 


```r
library(sf)
wgs84_crs = "+init=EPSG:4326"
UTM_crs = "+init=EPSG:32643"

Wildbook_points_coords<-Wildbook_points_coords[complete.cases(Wildbook_points_coords),]

Wildbook_pts_latlong<-st_as_sf(Wildbook_points_coords, coords = c("Latitude","Longitude"), crs = wgs84_crs)

#We can plot the coordinates to make sure they are correctly configured. 

plot(Wildbook_pts_latlong[1])
```


Then we can transform the points back into UTM. 

```r
Wildbook_pts_utm<-st_transform(Wildbook_pts_latlong, crs = UTM_crs)
```




```r
#extract the UTM coordinates
Wildbook_pts_utm_df<- st_coordinates(Wildbook_pts_utm)

#add the UTM coordinates bto the Wildbook_points_coords object
Wildbook_points_coords<-cbind(Wildbook_points_coords, Wildbook_pts_utm_df)

#merge the coordinates back to the Wildbook dataframe. 
Wildbook_points<-merge(Wildbook_points_coords, Wildbook_points, by=c("Location.ID", "Latitude", "Longitude"))
```


A few more pieces of data are needed, mainly the Session information and the Occassion. In our case, for modeling purposes this time, these will initially be set to 1. We will change these later. 

```r
Wildbook_points$Session<-1
Wildbook_points$Occassion<-1
Wildbook_points$species = "Snow Leopard"
```


Next, we will use the camTrapR package to create a matrix of camera operations.

We will use our metadata with the dates the cameras were intially deployed and then taken down. 

The package can also accommodate any problems with the cameras during the session, for example, if one camera had a technical issue 
and had to be taken down and replaced a month later, that would be included in separate columns for problems. 
In our case, we do not have any data about problems, so we set this parameter to FALSE.

The result of this function is a site x dates matrix of which days the cameras were operational.


```r
dateormat <- "%Y-%m-%d"

Metadata$Start<-as.Date(Metadata$Start)
Metadata$End<-as.Date(Metadata$End)

# alternatively, use "dmy" (requires package "lubridate")
library(camtrapR)
camop_problem <- cameraOperation(CTtable      = Metadata,
                                 stationCol   = "Trap.site",
                                 setupCol     = "Start",
                                 retrievalCol = "End",
                                 hasProblems  = FALSE,
                                 dateFormat   = dateFormat)
```


The oSCR program requires the data come in a specific format to run the models. Here we will wrangle the data into the proper format. In our case, we will simply subset our dataframe into the necssary columns.

The first dataframe we want to create is a record of the individual occurrences with the dates, trap site, side and quality. 


```r
#create the subset dataframe
edf<-Wildbook_points[,c("Marked.Individual", "date_Time","Location.ID","Side","Quality", "Juvenilles")]

#convert the dates to date format
edf$date_Time<-as.Date(edf$date_Time)
```


We will also create a dataframe based on site and GPS coordinates. Here, we want to use the data in UTM coordinates.


```r
tdf<-unique(Wildbook_points_coords[,c("Location.ID","X", "Y")])
```

Now, we will create a merged dataframe with all elements both the dataframe with the GPS coordinates and the dataframe with the information for the individual IDs.

We will save this file for the next lesson.


```r
edf_tdf<-merge(edf,tdf,by="Location.ID")
```

Eliminate any duplicated values, this table containes duplicates from the way whiskerbook can create multiple encounters from the same occurrence, so the data are a bit messy.


```r
write.csv(edf_tdf, "edf_tdf.csv")
```
The oSCR program requires we append the camera operation matrix to the tdf table with the GPS coordinates.

In order to make this as clear as possible, we will rename our camera operations matrix with numbers for each date, instead of the dates themselves. 

```r
#create dataframe objects for the camera operations matrix and the detections.
camop_problem<-as.data.frame(camop_problem)
detectionDays<-as.data.frame(colnames(camop_problem))

#create a sequential numeric vector for the number of detection dates
detectionDays$Occasion<-1:nrow(detectionDays)

#rename the columns
colnames(detectionDays)<-c("Dates","Occasion")

#rename the columns with the numeric vector
colnames(camop_problem)<-detectionDays$Occasion

#make a new column of the trap site names so we can merge the dataframes
camop_problem$Location.ID<-rownames(camop_problem)
```

Next, we will check whether the locations in the GPS coordinates columns exactly match the camera operability matrix. 

```r
setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, camop_problem$Location.ID)
```

Next, we will check whether the locations in the tdf dataframe with the GPS coordinates columns exactly match the edf dataframe about the individuals.


```r
setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, edf$Location.ID)
```


Now we can merge our camera operability matrix to our tdf dataframe with the camera operability matrix. 

```r
#merge the GPS coordinates table with the camera operations matrix
tdf<-merge(tdf, camop_problem, by="Location.ID", all=TRUE)

#remove the column with the trap names from the camera operations matrix
camop_problem<-camop_problem[,-ncol(camop_problem)]
```

In our edf dataframe about the individuals, then we need to convert our individual names to sequential numbers for clarity. 


```r
#convert the individual ID's and locations to sequential numbers for clarity.
edf$ID<-as.integer(as.factor(edf$Marked.Individual))
```

Check again to make sure the names of the Location.ID columns match.

```r
setdiff(edf$Location.ID, tdf$Location.ID)
setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, edf$Location.ID)
```



Write the files to csv so we can use them later. 

```r
write.csv(edf, "edf.csv")
write.csv(tdf, "tdf.csv")
```
