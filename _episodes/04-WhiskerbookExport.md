Here are a few of the packages we will be using in this session. Let's load them first thing. 



We will import the Whiskerbook file that was exported from the website interface. We are finished with the individual identification tasks. These are the raw data that were downloaded and then annotated with labels for whether the photo capture was high or low quality, and if the encounter showed the left or right side of the animal only. 


```r
setwd("Your Working Directory/WhiskerbookTrainingMaterials/")
```

```
## Error in setwd("Your Working Directory/WhiskerbookTrainingMaterials/"): cannot change working directory
```

```r
Wildbook<-read.csv("Whiskerbook_export.csv")
```

```
## Warning in file(file, "rt"): cannot open file 'Whiskerbook_export.csv': No such
## file or directory
```

```
## Error in file(file, "rt"): cannot open the connection
```

Let's do some quick data crunching to find out how many individuals we have in our dataset. 


```r
#To find the number of individuals that are in the dataset
IndividualsCount<-Wildbook%>%
  count(Name0.value, sort = TRUE) 
```

```
## Error in count(., Name0.value, sort = TRUE): object 'Wildbook' not found
```

```r
IndividualsCount2<-IndividualsCount%>%
  count(n, sort = TRUE) 
```

```
## Error in count(., n, sort = TRUE): object 'IndividualsCount' not found
```

```r
Individuals<-unique(Wildbook$Name0.value)
```

```
## Error in unique(Wildbook$Name0.value): object 'Wildbook' not found
```





```r
#To find the number of encounters on each side of the animal and quality
Sides<-Wildbook%>%
  group_by(Side, Quality)%>%
  count(sort = TRUE) 
```

```
## Error in group_by(., Side, Quality): object 'Wildbook' not found
```

```r

Wildbook$date_Time<-paste(Wildbook$Encounter.year, Wildbook$Encounter.month, sep="-")
```

```
## Error in paste(Wildbook$Encounter.year, Wildbook$Encounter.month, sep = "-"): object 'Wildbook' not found

Load the metadata


```r
Metadata<-read.csv("Metadata_CT_2012_2.csv")
```

```
## Warning in file(file, "rt"): cannot open file 'Metadata_CT_2012_2.csv': No such

```

```
## Error in merge(Metadata, Wildbook, by = "Trap.site", by.y = "Encounter.locationID", : object 'Metadata' not found

Challenge how to fix these missed entries? From a previous lesson we learned how to manipulate the data to have matching file names.

Next, we will use the camTrapR package to create a matrix of camera operations. We will use our metadata with the dates the cameras were intially deployed and then taken down. The package can also accommodate any problems with the cameras during the session, for example, if one camera had a technical issue and had to be taken down and replaced a month later, that would be included in separate columns for problems. The result of this function is a site x dates matrix of which days the cameras were operational.


```r
dateormat <- "%Y-%m-%d"

Metadata$Start<-as.Date(Metadata$Start)
```

```
## Error in as.Date(Metadata$Start): object 'Metadata' not found
```

```r
Metadata$End<-as.Date(Metadata$End)
```

```
## Error in as.Date(Metadata$End): object 'Metadata' not found
```

```r
# alternatively, use "dmy" (requires package "lubridate")
library(camtrapR)
camop_problem <- cameraOperation(CTtable      = Metadata,
                                 stationCol   = "Trap.site",
                                 setupCol     = "Start",
                                 retrievalCol = "End",
                                 hasProblems  = FALSE,
                                 dateFormat   = dateFormat
)
```

```
## Error in is.data.frame(df): object 'Metadata' not found
```


The oSCR program requires the data come in a specific format to run the models. Here we will wrangle the data into the proper format. In our case, we will simply subset our dataframe into the necssary columns.

The first dataframe we want to create is a record of the individual occurrences with the dates, trap site, side and quality. 


```r
#create the subset dataframe
edf<-Wildbook_points[,c("Marked.Individual", "date_Time","Location.ID","Side","Quality", "Juvenilles")]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Wildbook_points' not found
```

```r
#convert the dates to date format
edf$date_Time<-as.Date(edf$date_Time)
```

```
## Error in as.Date(edf$date_Time): object 'edf' not found
```


We will also create a dataframe based on site and GPS coordinates. Here, we want to use the data in UTM coordinates.


```r
tdf<-unique(Wildbook_points_coords[,c("Location.ID","X", "Y")])
```

```
## Error in unique(Wildbook_points_coords[, c("Location.ID", "X", "Y")]): object 'Wildbook_points_coords' not found
```

Now, we will create a merged dataframe with all elements both the dataframe with the GPS coordinates and the dataframe with the information for the individual IDs.

We will save this file for the next lesson.


```r
edf_tdf<-merge(edf,tdf,by="Location.ID")
```

```
## Error in merge(edf, tdf, by = "Location.ID"): object 'edf' not found
```


Eliminate any duplicated values, this table containes duplicates from the way whiskerbook can create multiple encounters from the same occurrence, so the data are a bit messy in this sense.


```r
write.csv(edf_tdf, "edf_tdf.csv")
```

```
## Error in is.data.frame(x): object 'edf_tdf' not found
```



The oSCR program requires we append the camera operation matrix to the table with the GPS coordinates.

In order to make this as clear as possible, we will rename our camera operations matrix with numbers for each date, instead of the dates themselves. 

```r
#create dataframe objects for the camera operations matrix and the detections.
camop_problem<-as.data.frame(camop_problem)
```

```
## Error in as.data.frame(camop_problem): object 'camop_problem' not found
```

```r
detectionDays<-as.data.frame(colnames(camop_problem))
```

```
## Error in is.data.frame(x): object 'camop_problem' not found
```

```r
#create a sequential numeric vector for the number of detection dates
detectionDays$Occasion<-1:nrow(detectionDays)
```

```
## Error in nrow(detectionDays): object 'detectionDays' not found
```

```r
#rename the columns
colnames(detectionDays)<-c("Dates","Occasion")
```

```
## Error in colnames(detectionDays) <- c("Dates", "Occasion"): object 'detectionDays' not found
```

```r
#rename the columns with the numeric vector
colnames(camop_problem)<-detectionDays$Occasion
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'detectionDays' not found
```

```r
#make a new column of the trap site names so we can merge the dataframes
camop_problem$Location.ID<-rownames(camop_problem)
```

```
## Error in rownames(camop_problem): object 'camop_problem' not found
```


```r
setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, camop_problem$Location.ID)
```

```
## Error in setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, camop_problem$Location.ID): object 'tdf' not found
```



```r
setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, edf$Location.ID)
```

```
## Error in setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, edf$Location.ID): object 'tdf' not found
```


```r
camop_problem$Location.ID
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'camop_problem' not found
```



```r
setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, camop_problem$Location.ID)
```

```
## Error in setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, camop_problem$Location.ID): object 'tdf' not found
```




```r
#merge the GPS coordinates table with the camera operations matrix
tdf<-merge(tdf, camop_problem, by="Location.ID", all=TRUE)
```

```
## Error in merge(tdf, camop_problem, by = "Location.ID", all = TRUE): object 'tdf' not found
```

```r
#remove the column with the trap names from the camera operations matrix
camop_problem<-camop_problem[,-ncol(camop_problem)]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'camop_problem' not found
```


```r
#convert the individual ID's and locations to sequential numbers for clarity.
edf$ID<-as.integer(as.factor(edf$Marked.Individual))
```

```
## Error in is.factor(x): object 'edf' not found
```

Check to make sure the names of the Location.ID columns match.

```r
setdiff(edf$Location.ID, tdf$Location.ID)
```

```
## Error in setdiff(edf$Location.ID, tdf$Location.ID): object 'edf' not found
```

```r
setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, edf$Location.ID)
```

```
## Error in setdiff(tdf$Location.ID, edf$Location.ID): object 'tdf' not found
```



Write the files to csv so we can use them later. 

```r
write.csv(edf, "edf.csv")
```

```
## Error in is.data.frame(x): object 'edf' not found
```

```r
write.csv(tdf, "tdf.csv")
```

```
## Error in is.data.frame(x): object 'tdf' not found
```
